This is registration software for the Kickboxing World Championships held in Dublin Ireland 2011.

It is build on PHP Symfony 1.4 and MySQL

NOTICE:
 - Event table: field event_id is hardcoded in sfGuardRegister 
	         action (path: plugins/sfDoctrineGuard/modules/sfGuardRegister/actions)
 - If this is to be used for another event then the event_discipline connection will need to be coded. The idea here is that each event should have a list of active disciplines. In the form it should only show disciplines that are in this link table i.e. active and of course all sub-divisions too.
